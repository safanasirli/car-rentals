        "description": "Entry-level models provide shoppers with an affordably priced way into a luxury carmaker's lineup, and the A-class fills this role in the Mercedes-Benz product range. This subcompact sedan is the smallest car in automaker's selection of vehicles; it's also the least expensive. With a long list of standard features, a premium-looking cabin, and relatively accessible pricing, the 2020 Mercedes-Benz A-class offers good value. Despite its small footprint, this sedan provides spacious accommodations for passengers, with a respectable amount of legroom for adults in the back seat. Keep in mind, however, that rival models offer more cargo space. Overall, this baby Mercedes shines as a top choice among entry-level luxury sedans.",
